Issues I experienced:
- After cloning this repository, you may need to update your nuget package for Xamarin.Forms
- If out of memory error on build for Java, Right click FishOnMobileApp.Droid project -> Properties -> Android Options -> Advanced. Set Java Max Heap Size to 1G

- You will need to create a Google Maps API Key, and a Windows Auth Token, details on how to do that and where to update the src can be found here: https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/xamarin-forms/user-interface/map/
